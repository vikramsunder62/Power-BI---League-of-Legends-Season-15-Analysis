League of Legends Seaon 15 Dashboard - K Vikram Sundar

Project Description: The project is based on analysis of Season 15 Split 1 data of League of Legends which a popular MOBA developed by Riot Games and the dataset is derived from Kaggle where the goal is to clean,transform and analyse the data and prepare interactive dashboard which contains relevant insights using Power BI.

Approach: We import the given dataset into Power BI and begin with cleaning and transformation of the game data with Power Query. Later we use this data to create various summarizations using Tables and Matrix along with the required DAX measures to build a dashboard with various charts/graphs to visualize the data.

Tools/Technologies Used: In this project , we use Power BI as the primary tool to gather relevant insights from the given data. We use data cleaning and data using Power Query and use Power BI to develop interactive and customizable visualizations in the form of charts/graphs to create a sophisticated dashboard.

Insights: The dashboard contains key metrics such as Total Number of Champions, Number of Melee Champions, Number of Ranged Champions, Average Difficulty of Melee Champions, Average Difficulty of Ranged Champions, Name of Oldest Champion and Name of Newest Champion .It also contains various visualizations to represent factors such as Champions by Type/Role, Champions by Trait (Physical or Magic), Champions by Range Type (Melee or Ranged), Champions by Cost in Blue Essence and Champions by Difficulty.

Result: The end-result is a high-end interactive dashboard developed using Power BI to showcase the insights with a sophisticated design which helps the stakeholders to understand the insights easier and also interact with the dashboard to additionally filter the data as per requirement.

Overall Learning and Progress: This project really helped me to understand the working of Power BI on an advanced level by cleaning and transforming the data using Power Query which is a powerful tool integrated into Power BI for data cleaning and transformation. I was also able to enhance my learning of DAX by creating various DAX measures with advanced filtering to create measures which were later used in the visualization of data. Using various charts/graphs to summarize the data in the form of a dashboard, it helped enhance my understanding of the core featues of Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling and use them effectively.
